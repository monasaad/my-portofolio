            services to demonstrate to the end-user - the student - how to use the service, how to reach the service, what its requirements, 
            and more service-related information in one infographic. I gathered the requirements, minified the information, and used visual aid 
            icons to make it simple and understandable by the end-user. The below image is an infographic I have created for a service.
