            para="Another designing task assigned to me during my training in IAU, 
            is to enhance the printing quality of an existing academic weekly planner of the first 
            term, as the printing quality was not good for A4 size. I suggested creating a new design 
            that has a different structure from the existing one. I started the design using the same 
            colors, fonts, and information then I added some enhancements such as redesigning the layout 
            from verticle to horizontal, adding comments lines to enable the user to write notes for each 
            day, and adding the university's website as a QR code. I also created further enhancements as 
            requested like resizing the page to be two pages in A4 size and one page in A3 size. The below
             image is the current design of the academic weekly planner of the second term. 
             This planner was posted on the official Twitter account of the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University admission and registration deanship
